## Introduction

Laravel includes the ability to seed your database with data using seed classes. All seed classes are stored in the database/seeders directory.
Same as in Laravel with Eloquent, you can use default Laravel seeders to seed your data into the database, by using CycleORM database factories.

## ✏️ Writing Seeders

Seeder classes are generated, same as it is in Laravel, using the `make:seeder` Artisan command. These classes are stored in the database/seeders directory. Seeder classes may have any name you wish, but probably should follow some sensible convention, such as `PostSeeder`, `CommentSeeder`, `UserSeeder` etc.

```bash
php artisan make:seeder PostSeeder
```

## ⚡️ Using Entity Factories

Best way to use seeders is to use Entity Factories, which is provided by [wayofdev/laravel-cycle-orm-factories](https://github.com/wayofdev/laravel-cycle-orm-factories). You can create a factory for each of your entities and use them to seed your database.

In this documentation section we will use examples from [Factories](/services/factories) documentation page.

For example, let's create 20 posts and 10 comments for each post:

```php
<?php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Database\Factories\Post\PostFactory;
use Database\Factories\Post\Comment\CommentFactory;
use Database\Factories\User\UserFactory;

final class PostSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run(): void
    {
        $author = UserFactory::new()->createOne();
        $posts = PostFactory::new()->withUser($author)->times(20)->create();

        $collection->each(function (Post $post): void {
            CommentFactory::new([
                'post' => $post,
            ])->times(10)->create();
        });
    }
}
```
